## Technologies Used to Build GA Networking

For our app, we used Express to handle back-end functionality and React to handle front-end functionality. We used PostGreSQL to create our databases and the Google Material Design framework for our CSS. We also incorporated the Meetup API for our Events page.

## General Approach To Building The App

When we first had the idea for this app, we wanted to build a dating app for GA students, both because we thought it would be fun but also because the challenge of building even a basic dating app excited us. However, we spoke to some UX Design students about our app in the beginning stages and they seemed to struggle with the purpose of our app. They suggested we pivot and repurpose our app as a networking tool for GA students who may not get the chance to interact with others outside of their own cohorts. We figured we would not have to change much of what we were planning to implement in terms of basic components, and it allowed us to avoid any potentially thorny social issues that had come up initially.

Once that decision to pivot was made, we set about getting to work on building the app by splitting the group so that two of us would build everything on the backend while the other two would build the React components on the front end. Since the Express portion of the app was mostly completed within the first couple days of building the app, all four of us began to work on the front end while each of us focusing on specific components. We started by working everything associated with authentication (Home page, login and register pages), the user profiles and messaging components. We then moved to the feed and events components. Again, we split duties here, with a couple of us working on functionality while the others worked on styling. When someone had an issue, the others in the group would gladly help out if they could. Workflow throughout the project was fairly seamless, with the only conflicts being very minor and easy to solve.
