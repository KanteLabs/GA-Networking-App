# GA-Networking

## Technologies Used to Build GA Networking

For our app, we used Express to handle back-end functionality and React to handle front-end functionality. We used PostGreSQL to create our databases and the Google Material Design framework for our CSS. We also incorporated the Meetup API for our Events page.
