## What is GA Tinder?

### NOTE: USE OF THE "TINDER" NAME IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

There are a lot of dating apps out there. Many of us have used at least one of  them at some point. There are dating apps for all kinds of different groups, but our group of enterprising young WDI students here at General Assembly New York want to make a dating app just for people here and, if it were to become a more expansive project, the tech community at large. While it would be great to actually put it into use for our campus, our ultimate goal is to educate ourselves by attempting to craft a simulacrum (yes, fancy word here) of one of the most popular types of apps on the market today.

## How Will the App Work?

Upon loading of the app, the user will be met with the App logo and buttons to either register or login. For new users, they will click on the register button. Upon load, the user will have to input their desired username and password as well as his or her e-mail, first name, and last name. 

Once those fields are filled out, the user will then be redirected to their own profile page. On this profile page, The user will have the ability to upload a main profile photo by clicking on a button. On click, the user will be able to choose a photo(s) from their computer/phone (stretch goal here) to insert for their image. User will also have to fill in input fields for their age and interest (men, women, or other if you're nasty). There will also be a text area where users can write a short blurb describing themselves however they choose. There will most likely be an as yet undetermined character limit for this section.
